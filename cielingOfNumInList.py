# In this problem we have to find a number equal to or the smallest greatest number to the given target number.

#     so we use binary search for this
#     case 1: mid==target
#         so we have found a number equal to the target. problem solved
#     case 2 : element is not in the array
#         in this case we would reach the start>end and the while loop would stop.
#         and the next greater element would be pointed at by the start.
#         so the ceiling of the number would be arr[start].
