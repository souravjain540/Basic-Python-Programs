# Basic-Python-Programs

This project seems to have been ended in October of 2022.
I have forked it and want it to continue if anyone is interested. If not, I wiil just use it as
a cloud backup for my Python learning algorithms and stuff.  But anyone is free to add as long as 
they follow the 4 or 5 basic rules..
This repository contains basic python 3 programms, algorithms  and problem solutions.
